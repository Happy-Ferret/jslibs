/* MS doc:

	To illustrate this, consider the following example:

	   - .EXE is linked with MSVCRT.LIB
	   - DLL A is linked with LIBCMT.LIB
	   - DLL B is linked with CRTDLL.LIB

	If the .EXE creates a CRT file handle using _create() or _open(), this file handle may only be passed to _lseek(), _read(), _write(), _close(), etc. in the .EXE file. Do not pass this CRT file handle to either DLL. Do not pass a CRT file handle obtained from either DLL to the other DLL or to the .EXE.
	If DLL A allocates a block of memory with malloc(), only DLL A may call free(), _expand(), or realloc() to operate on that block. You cannot call malloc() from DLL A and try to free that block from the .EXE or from DLL B.
	NOTE: If all three modules were linked with CRTDLL.LIB or all three were linked with MSVCRT.LIb, these restrictions would not apply.
